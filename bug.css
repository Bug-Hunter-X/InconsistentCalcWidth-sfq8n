The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with percentages and `em` units:

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% - 2em);
}
```

The intention is to create a container whose width is 50% of its parent's width, minus 2em. However, depending on the context, `em` might not be calculated as expected, sometimes leading to unexpected results because the reference for `em` is not consistent in all cases.  It can lead to unpredictable widths. 

Another common error is the use of units within `calc()` that aren't compatible.  For example:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 50%); /* Incorrect */
}
```

This will likely fail because pixels (`px`) and percentages (`%`) are not directly additive in this manner within `calc()`.

To resolve the issue, it's recommended to avoid using `em` units within `calc()` alongside percentages unless the context of `em` unit is meticulously controlled. A more reliable approach is to use a fixed unit like pixels (`px`) or viewport units (`vw`):

```css
/* Solution 1: Using pixels */
.container {
  width: calc(50% - 32px);
}

/* Solution 2: Using viewport width units (vw) */
.container {
  width: calc(50vw - 2em);
}
```

Choosing between pixels and viewport units depends on whether you want the element's size to be relative to the parent container or the viewport.  Using `vw` creates a width relative to the viewport which is often more consistent and predictable.
